LAN PST Backup System

📌 Overview

LAN PST Backup System is a PowerShell-based project designed to collect and back up Microsoft Outlook PST files from multiple Windows systems over a LAN.

The system uses Windows network access (SMB) with system username, password, and IP address to remotely access machines and copy PST files to a central backup location.

This solution is ideal for:
	•	IT administrators
	•	Enterprise email backup
	•	Centralized Outlook data collection
	•	Compliance and archiving purposes

⸻

🛠️ Technology Stack
	•	PowerShell
	•	Windows SMB / Administrative Access
	•	LAN Network (TCP/IP)
	•	Windows Authentication (Username & Password)

⸻

⚙️ How It Works
	1.	The script connects to remote systems using:
	•	System IP address
	•	Windows username
	•	Windows password
	2.	It accesses common Outlook PST locations such as:
	•	C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Outlook Files
	•	C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook
	3.	All .pst files are copied over the LAN
	4.	Files are stored in a central backup directory, organized by:
	•	Computer name
	•	Username
	•	Date/time (optional)



🔐 Requirements
	•	Windows OS (Client & Server)
	•	PowerShell 5.1 or later
	•	Network connectivity between systems
	•	Administrative access to target machines
	•	File sharing enabled on remote systems
	•	Firewall allows SMB (Port 445)
